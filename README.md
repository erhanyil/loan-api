# Loan API Backend

This is a Spring Boot-based backend application for managing loans in a bank. It provides endpoints to create, list, and pay loans for customers. The system also supports handling installment payments, loan creation with interest rates, and due dates. It includes a robust authentication system with **JWT tokens** for security and user authorization.

-   **Create Loan**: Create a new loan for a customer with an amount, interest rate, and number of installments.
-   **List Loans**: List all loans for a specific customer.
-   **List Installments**: List installments for a given loan.
-   **Pay Loan**: Pay installments for a loan with rewards and penalties based on payment timing.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Secure the application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for both **ADMIN** and **CUSTOMER** users.

## Prerequisites

-   Java 21

## User Roles

The system supports two types of users:

-   **ADMIN**
    -   Can manage loans and installments for all customers.
    -   Example user: `username: admin@example.com, password: 123, role: ADMIN`
-   **CUSTOMER**
    -   Can only manage loans and installments for their own account.
    -   Example users:
        -   `username: john.doe@example.com, password: 123, role: CUSTOMER`
        -   `username: jane.smith@example.com, password: 123, role: CUSTOMER`

### Authorization Header

All API endpoints are secured with basic authentication using JWT tokens. To generate a token, use the `/auth/token` endpoint. Once you have the token, include it in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:

bash

Copy code

`Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token_here>`

## Database Schema

### Customer Table

-   `id`: Unique identifier
-   `name`: Customer's first name
-   `surname`: Customer's last name
-   `creditLimit`: Total available credit limit for the customer
-   `usedCreditLimit`: Amount of credit already used by the customer

### Loan Table

-   `id`: Unique identifier for the loan
-   `customerId`: Foreign key referencing the customer
-   `loanAmount`: The total amount of the loan
-   `numberOfInstallment`: Number of installments for the loan
-   `createDate`: Date when the loan was created
-   `isPaid`: Boolean indicating whether the loan is fully paid

### LoanInstallment Table

-   `id`: Unique identifier for the installment
-   `loanId`: Foreign key referencing the loan
-   `amount`: The amount of the installment
-   `paidAmount`: The amount that has been paid for the installment
-   `dueDate`: The due date for the installment (set to the first day of the month)

## Testing

Unit tests are written using JUnit and Mockito. To run tests:

Copy code

`mvn test`

## Bonus Features

### 1. **Customer vs Admin Authorization**:

Customers can only access and manage their own loans, while Admin users can manage loans for all customers.

### 2. **Reward and Penalty**:

-   **Early Payment**: A discount is applied based on how many days before the due date the payment is made.
-   **Late Payment**: A penalty is applied based on how many days after the due date the payment is made.

## Conclusion

This Spring Boot application provides a comprehensive solution for managing loans, handling customer credit, and applying payment rewards or penalties. Itâ€™s designed to be deployed in a production or test environment and is fully secured with role-based authorization using JWT.
